/**
 * This class handles the keyboard events. It knows the last known state of its
 * keys
 *
 * Some parts of this class are pretty complex, but the class itself is fairly
 * easy to use. You just instantiate one object in your game and us the method
 * `isKeyDown()` to check if a specific key is currently pressed down by the
 * user.
 *
 * It is also possible to check whether a key is typed in the previous frame.
 * A key is typed when it was down for at least one frame time and the
 * released. In order to make this work, the `onFrameStart()` method must be
 * called at each animationFrame.
